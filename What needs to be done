Things that need to be worked on for the database:

>Continue to make things look presentable

>Create a button that submits information to different tables depending on what is selected from a drop down menu
=>For example, if I want to put in a specific screw, I want to choose screw from a menu and then type in the name of the screw.  That name then only populates a certain table 
==>(I guess technically this is done, as there's a table in which you can access each category, click on show and see the contents)

>Implement and add the ability to manipulate the amount of each item.
=>For example, I have 50 screws, then I use 5 of them.  I need to update the information so it reflects that I now only have 45

>Investiage the best way to host the server so it is something many people can access instead of having to make updates based on computer
=>I asked Dave, the guy from WIT, if he had any suggestions about this.  He said we can host it from an IP for no cost so we will see.
